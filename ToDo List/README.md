# ToDo List Project

A to-do list with a simple design that I developed to apply my programming knowledge.

## Instructions

Write a task in the text input and click on the plus button. The task will be added, click on the checkbox according to the accomplishment of the task, you can delete the task using the wastebasket button.

## Versions

Version 1.0.

Future Versions - Depending on whether the checkbox is selected or not, change the color of the task to light green (task completed) or light red (task to be completed). Add a button to edit the task.
